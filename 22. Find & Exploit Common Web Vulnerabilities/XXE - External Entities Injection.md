## **Exploitation**

We are given a website with a function to upload an `XML` file with the given format

```xml
<creds> 
<user>test</user> 
<password>test</password> 
</creds>
```

We can create a **XML** file with the content as shown above and try to upload it then fire up `burpsuite`, intercept request and send to **repeater**

Surely, as we can see in the above image our result is been passed to the `user` and `password` field, this means we can get our **XML injection** to execute in this area of the response, by using the following payload

```xml
!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM "/etc/passwd"> ]>
<creds> 
<user>&example;</user> 
<password>test</password> 
</creds>
```

**Note :** Also try to send XML payload to something that accept `JSON` endpoint as this may still lead to an XML injection attack
