## **Walk Through**

For this lab we will be using `sqlmap` and `burpsuite` as our primary tool

We are given this website together with the username and password, type in your creds which is `jeremy:jeremy` and make sure you start up burp to intercept traffic

We can intercept the traffic with and forward it, If we navigate to **Proxy>>HTTP history** viewing the response of the request we forwarded we can see that we got a message that says **"Welcome to your Dashboard!"**

Now check this **HTTP history** tab and you should see a request as shown below, send it to **Repeater** (`Ctrl+R`)

We can perform a basic SQLI in the username field, type in `jeremy' OR 1=1#` with several other basic SQLI you know that shows a POC that SQLI is possible there

**Note :** your payload might not be encoded as mine, you can highlight the area of the payload e.g `' OR 1=1#'` and click `Ctrl+U` on your keyboard, you can then do `Ctrl+Shift+U` to do the reverse

As usual you shouldn't be able to log in 😆, This is where automated scanning comes in, we can use `sqlmap` to perform automated SQLI
- First of all make sure that the username and password remains `jeremy:jeremy`
- Now right click on the `Request` tab and click `save item`, then save it as **requests.txt**

Running `sqlmap -r <request-file> --dbs` we can see that the **Username** and **Password** field appears not to be vulnerable to SQLI

Navigating back to **Proxy>>Http history** in burpsuite we can see that comparing requests the website is validating the `Cookie: session=`

We can take advantage of this and make it our injection point 👨‍💻, send this particular request to repeater and let try it out
