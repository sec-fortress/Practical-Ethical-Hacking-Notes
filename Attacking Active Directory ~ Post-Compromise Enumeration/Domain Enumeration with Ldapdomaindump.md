## **When to Use?**

If IPv6 is not possible in a network and we do want to compromise an account, well, this tool is a **"TO-GO"** for us.

## **Example Usage**

**Note:** LDAP requires a bind credential -- can be a low-level domain user -- in order to connect to the LDAP service and run queries.

```powershell
# Make a directory and switch to it
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/PEH/AD$ mkdir marvel.local

sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/PEH/AD$ cd marvel.local

sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/PEH/AD/marvel.local$

# For help message
